## Why to Organize?
* Opening an old file, and taking time to understand the script is an usual problem, especially with large scripts.
* Sometimes, files from friends, colleagues, employees, or even on the forum can be hard to read and understand.
* If it takes too much time to just understand the file, people might not be motivated to solve an issue, or provide their insights on the forum.
* Within an organization, it is easier to track changes, identify bugs, and fix them if the file is organised.
* It also helps someone to continue working on your file, or use your file as a starting point, thus promoting collaborations.
* Generalizing file structure makes it easy to understand what can be modified, and what should not be. It also reduces the space to make assumptions, and guess work.
* A common structure / style makes it easy for users of any skill level understand the file's content faster.

## Styling GH_Scripts
* There is currently no style guide (like PEP8 for Python) or even a consolidated list of good practices for Grasshopper Scripts.
* This could be because there is a variety of applications for Grasshopper for different people, and it is hard to generalize it.
* But, there have been discussions time and again on this topic.
* A style guide is not a rule, but a proposal for a convention. It is only useful if adopted by a lot of people.
* Too many things to follow also make it hard / tedious for a casual user. While this can be offset to an extent by using templates, having simple to follow solutions would make sure everyone can follow.
* General guidelines for publishing grasshopper file can help standardize professional documentation. (UML diagrams, XML format, Refactoring, etc.)
* Ideas from SOLID / KISS / UML Diagrams can be borrowed.
