# Zettelkasten using Obsidian
Created : 08-02-2022 21:42

Zettelkasten is a way to organise, track, and manage knowledge by inter-linking information based on source.

***The key components of any Zettel are:***
1. Source of Inspiration - Fleeting Notes
2. Your personal insight - Literature Notes
3. Using these insights to create multiple Map of Content projects. - Permanent Notes

The aim is not to create a database of information, rather a network of insights around various topics. This means, the Zettelkasten method might be more suited for non-factual information.

***Example:***
Trying to include technical topics might result in the creation of a documentation for the topic. But, information about the method / thought process behind the method, can be included / documented.

The reason behind creating a Zettelkasten database is to try to link different aspects of the same topic, to look for possible cross-references. It could be useful to expand knowledge horizontally, for a more generalist approach to things.

 I personally believe being able to think across multiple streams is useful to solve problems with a different view. Maybe following the Zettelkasten method would lead to more divergent thought processes.
