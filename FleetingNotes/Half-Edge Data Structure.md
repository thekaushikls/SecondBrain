# Half-Edge Data Structure
Created : 28-02-2022 08:46

### Introduction
* Abbreviated as HalfedgeDS or HDS.
* It is a data structure focussing on edges, and their relation to other elements such as edges(other), vertices, faces, etc. that can be used to construct complex planar maps, polyhedra, and other **two dimensional** surfaces.
* HalfedgeDS is more of an implementation layer (How things are done). So, user control is provided usually by classes that wrap / are built on top of HDS.

### Software Design
