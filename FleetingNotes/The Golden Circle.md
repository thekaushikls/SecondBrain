# The Golden Circle
Created : 09-02-2022 11:35

* Why are certain companies are always more innovative than the rest?
* Why do certain people shine more than the rest? (Wright Brothers / Martin Luther King)
* They all seem to follow a pattern - the Golden Circle.
* InnerCircle: Why, MiddleCircle: How, OuterCircle: What
* Normal people go from outer to inner. Not everyone knows 'why' they do something or 'why' the company needs to exist.
* The innovative companies, people, etc., all think from the inside out.
* People don't buy what we do, they buy why we do what we do.
* People don't purchase products, they purchase the emotions associated with those products.
* Good companies focus on competing with these innovative companies. Great companies focus on improving their product to suit their users.
* The aim should be to focus on building relationships with those who have the same beliefs, rather than associating with everyone who has a requirement for your skill/service/product.
* If we don't know the 'why', it is hard to associate with people because people respond to the 'why'.

### Co-relation with Human Biology
* These claims are not based on Psychology - Human Behaviour, but Biology - something that has been evolving for millions of years.
* Human brain's inner structure roughly resemble the golden circle.
* The human brain(newest) - Neocortex - is responsible for logical / rational thoughts.
* The inner section - Lymbic Brain - Emotions and Feelings like Trust, Loyalty, responsible for decision making. Gut decisions are based from here.
* Starting with Why, talks directly to the inner brain, bypasses the logical system, and connects to the emotional system.

### Example:
**Samuel Pierpont Langley** had all the resources, money, and funding for finding success in powered aviation (Airplanes). He had the best employees, and the economy was great. But, inspite of having access to these resources, he couldn't figure it out. But we've not heard much about him.

**The Wright Brothers** were not even educated properly, and they had not so much resources. But they had a strong 'Why', unlike Samuel who was in pursuit of the end product. People who worked with Wright Brothers, worked out of passion, with blood and sweat, because they all had a common belief / why.

### Law of Diffusion of Innovation

* Why is it important to attract people who belive in what you believe?
* 2.5% - Innovators
* 13.5% - Early Adpoters
* 34% - Early Majority
* 34% - Late Majority
* 16% - Laggards

* Mass market success is not possible until the tipping point 15-18%
* Early Majority will not try something until someone has triedit.
* Early Adopters can take risks, make gut decisions, because of their belief. (ex. they wait in line for first day first show not becaust it is a great movie, but because they want to be first)
* Great leaders have a strong 'Why'. We follow them not for them, but for ourselves. Because we believe in what they believe.
* Leaders are positions of power. But those who lead, inspire others.
