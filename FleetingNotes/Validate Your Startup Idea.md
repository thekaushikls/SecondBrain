# Validate Your Startup Idea
Created : 25-02-2022 20:17

* Startups fail because it doesn't solve an important problem for a large enough audience.
* Validating the demand is very important, and is a top priority.
* Market validation makes sure one can save time, energy, and money.

### Step 1: What is the problem?
* Explain the problem clearly, in simple words.
* It cannot focus on a specific solution that you might already know about.
* Refine the problem statement until you can articulate it in one sentence.

### Step 2: Is it important enough?
* Are you the only person facing the problem?
* Do others face the exact same problem?
* Do they also see it as an important problem / needs to be solved urgently?
* Most founders ignore this part, and assume the problem is valid for everyone.
* Identify potential people who might face similar problems.
* Be professional, set up a meeting, prepare a few questions in prior.
* Validate the following:
	* Do they face the problem?
	* How severe is it?
	* How do they currently solve it?
	* Would they pay for a better solution?
* Never start on an idea that is only 'nice to have it fixed, but we can manage with current methods.'

### Step 3: Analyze existing solutions
* After talking to people, one might get a rough picture of how the landscape is, how important the problem is, and how it being handled currently.
* Existing solutions could be single product, or usually a bunch of tools / processes that work in total.
* If you already have competitors, and are doing well, it partially validates the problem and the market's demand for a solution.
* Be careful if there are no companies trying to solve the issue. Maybe there is no market, or your problem is not specifc. Find a niche, to work on.

### Step 4: Pain points in existing solutions
* No matter the current solution, identify pain points.
* List out dislikes, what can be improved / made faster.
* Your solution can have at-most 80% similar features with existing solutions.
* The rest needs to be different (not just for the sake of being different) and an original solution, that is distinctly better.
* List benefits for potential customers, so it is easy for your solution to be compared with competitors / current solutions.
* If they don't use a direct solution (like yours), identify the amount of manual work / time / effort that can be saved. This can also be listed as a benefit.

### Step 5: Is the solution feasible?
* Study your competitors. Are they growing fast?
* Do they have money? Are they raising money? Have they raised money in the past?
* How to they budget their solution(s)?
* Talk to potential customer(s), try to identify the affordability. Recap and establish the problem, show them how a solution can help (benefits), and find out a rough price range they are willing to pay.
* Try proposing your idea. Check if they are willing to support.
* If they are unable to decide / won't pay, try to find out deciding reasons.
* Do they have other contracts? Is the pricing un-optimal? Is it not an important problem? Maybe they need more time to think?
* Try to get atleast 5 people ready to buy your product when it will be ready.
* They may/mayn't really buy/pay, but it is a good validation for your idea/solution.

### Step 6: Define a roadmap.
* Once you have your small audience, keep open discussions about product features.
* Critical and core features cannot be changed. But, user-based features can be chosen based on request / popularity.
* Set up a feedback loop with customers.
