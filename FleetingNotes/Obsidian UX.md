* In most text editor applications, if the content exactly matches the page / screen height, the scrollbar is disabled.
* Obsidian's scroll bar makes sure, that the page can be scrolled until the new line is at the center of the screen.
* This makes it easier to type, and one can look at what they're typing, in screen-center irrespective of how big / small their app window is.
* I like how the scroll bar is configured.
