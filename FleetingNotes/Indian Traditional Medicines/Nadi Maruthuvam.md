* Siddha Medicine, Ayurvedha, and Nadi medicine use three common measurements.
* Vatham(vathanadi), Pitham(pithanadi), and Kapham(kaphanadi).
* Based on the balance (or imbalance) in these three measurements, the human body can be affected by different diseases.
* The ideal ratios of Vatham : Pitham : Kapham are 1 : 0.5 : 0.25, when the body is healthy.
* Vatham represents the Air.
* Pitham represents the Fire (Agni).
* Kapham represents Water.

*"Andathilullathe Pindam Pindathilullathe Andam"*
***Translation:*** Andam: The Universe, Pindam: Ball of rice.
***Meaning:*** The Universe, and our body follows a similar pattern. Both enclose each-other.

* Everything inside the body, is also present in the cosmos, in the same proportions.
* The Panchabhutham (5 elements) philosophy is the basis for everything.
* Water(Neer), Fire(Nerupu), Kaatru(Air), Aagayam(Space), Earth(Mannu)
* Fire is the primary element. That takes up different forms(elements)
* The (absence of) Fire element (as it morphs into other elements) creates Space.
* The three other forms represent the different levels of absense of Fire.
* If raw material(moola porul) is tightly packed, it becomes Solid phase (prithvi / bhoomi)
* If it is loosely packed, it forms liquid phase.
* If it even more loosely packed, it forms the air (gaseous phase).
* Earth is not included in Nadi medicinal principles. Only Air(vaatham), Fire(pitham) and Water(kapham) are included.

### Vaatham
* Vaatham can be reduced by eating specific foods, which are classified as vaatha-mudaki or vaatha-narayanan.
* If vaatham is higher:
	1. The person's arrogance(thimuru) might be high.
	2. He/She will feel hungry often.
	3. Tongue feels sour.
	4. Body pain, joint pains.
	5. May cause rheumatoid arthritis(mudakku vatham)
	6. May cause constipation(malachikkal)
	7. Face has wrinkles (pre-mature aging), or the person looks old.
	8. Causes gastronomic issues (acidity / acid-reflux, etc.)
	9. Person feels cold easily.

### Pitham
* If pitham is higher:
	1. Person feels warm.
	2. Identifiable by dryness in tongue.
	3. Heartburn (different from the ones caused by food)
	4. May cause Conjuctivitis. (kaamalai)
	5. May cause Anaemia (paandu)
	6. May cause headaches.
	7. May cause Dizziness.
	8. Urine is usually yellowish.

### Kapham
* If kapham is higher:
	1. Urination is reduced.
	2. Saliva is increased.
	3. Extreme cold, and shivering.
	4. Increased sweating.
	5. Bone pains.
	6. Causes cold, increased phelgm.

 * Each person's body is different. There is no single / specific quantity / dosage of medicine that works for everyone. Absorption of different foods depend on the person's body.
* So, usually the medicine is not given much importance, but the affected person is the priority. So, doctors usually check the current levels of the three parameters, even before asking the patient about their diseases / problems.
* This in contradiction to Allopathy / English / Formal medicinal practice, where the doctor first asks the patients for symptoms / problems, and medicine is based on the symptoms.
* It is recommended that a Sidda Doctor is consulted for better understanding. This is because, there is no one-stop-solution that works for everyone. Eg: Applying lampoil (vilaku ennai) on the head to reduce heat may work for some people, but not for another. They might even have some allergic reactions to it.
* It is better to be informed about the levels, and understand the reason behind any ailment before trying to cure it.
* Any information from anyone / internet is to be taken with a grain of salt. It may / mayn't work for you.
